Abstraction

Title: Bike Rental Management System

Software:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP, MySQL

Problem Definition:
The Bike Rental Management System aims to provide a platform for users to browse available bikes, make bookings, manage profiles, and for admins to manage bikes, bookings, and users. The system facilitates the rental process by allowing users to view bike listings, make bookings, and manage their profiles, while admins can oversee the entire rental process, manage bike listings, bookings, and user accounts.

Module List:
1. Admin Module
   1.1 User Management
   1.2 Bike Management
   1.3 Booking Management

2. User Module
   2.1 Bike Browsing
   2.2 Booking Management
   2.3 Profile Management

Module Description:

1. Admin Module:
   - 1.1 User Management:
     - Add User: Allows admin to add new users to the system.
     - Edit User: Enables admin to modify user details such as username, email, and password.
     - Deactivate User: Provides functionality to deactivate user accounts.
     - View Users: Allows admin to view a list of all registered users.

   - 1.2 Bike Management:
     - Add Bike: Allows admin to add new bikes to the system with details such as bike name, model, specification, and price.
     - Edit Bike: Enables admin to modify bike details such as name, model, specification, and price.
     - Remove Bike: Provides functionality to remove bikes from the system.
     - Track Bike Availability: Allows admin to track the availability status of bikes.

   - 1.3 Booking Management:
     - Approve/Reject Booking: Enables admin to approve or reject booking requests made by users.
     - Manage Booking Schedule: Provides functionality to manage booking schedules, including start and end dates.
     - View Bookings: Allows admin to view a list of all bookings made by users.

2. User Module:

     - Browse Bikes: Allows users to view available bikes with details such as name, model, specification, and price.
     - View Bike Details: Provides detailed information about each bike, including images and availability status.

     - Cancel Booking: Provides functionality for users to cancel their existing bookings.

   - 2.3 Profile Management:
     - View Profile: Allows users to view their profile information, including username, email, and booking history.
     - Edit Profile: Enables users to edit their profile information, including username, email, and password.
     - Deactivate Account: Provides functionality for users to deactivate their accounts permanently.

Highlights Points:
- Provides full abstraction of functionalities for both admins and users.
- Each module and sub-module encapsulates specific features related to user and admin operations.
- Ensures clear separation of concerns and ease of maintenance by organizing functionalities into well-defined modules.
- Facilitates smooth interaction between users and admins through intuitive interfaces and streamlined workflows.
